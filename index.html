    <p id="web-security-answer">Since there are multiple types of web-attacks, there are multiple things you can do against them: 2-step verification, sanitazion of the data to make sure it's in the right format for the system, using trusted 3rd party apps, using CI/CD to ensure that the code being deployed has passed a "quality check", having personell dedicated to network security, and last is setting up a timer for logging out in sessions where the user has not been active for a spesific timeperiod.
